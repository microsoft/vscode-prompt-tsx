# @vscode/prompt-tsx Samples

This directory contains samples for common patterns using the `@vscode/prompt-tsx` library. Each file contains an example of a component, with a docblock explaining its design. You can find the same content is a nicely-formatted way in the [VS Code Documentation for extension authors](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-guides/prompt-tsx).
